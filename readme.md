# **Anki Dark Mode Extension**

A simple browser extension that adds **dark mode** to the official [Anki website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

---

## **How It Works**
This extension injects custom CSS into the Anki website to override its default styles and apply a dark theme. It ensures all text, buttons, and other UI elements remain readable while reducing eye strain.
